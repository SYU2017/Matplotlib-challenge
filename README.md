 We observed three trends from “Pymaceuticals Inc” mice tumor treatment data:
1.	We pulled raw data from four mice tumor treatment groups(three drugs and one placebo) for analysis. Compared with the other two drugs and placebo treatment groups, Capomulin treatment group’s average tumor volume decreased from 45 mm3 to 36.23 mm3, about 19% decrease. The other three groups’ average tumor volume increased between 46% and 57%,  Ketapril group’s average tumor volumes increased most at 57%, which is worse than placebo group.
2.	All of four groups’ mice have metastatic spread during the treatment, Capomulin treatment group has least metastatic spread and Placebo group has the most metastatic spread.
3.	When compared the survival rate from first day of treatment to the 45 days, Capomulin treatment group’s mice has highest survival rate and Infubinol treatment group has the lowest survival rate.
4.	In conclusion,  Capomulin is a promising drug candidate for this kind of tumor warranting further investigation from this clinical trial's data analysis results.
